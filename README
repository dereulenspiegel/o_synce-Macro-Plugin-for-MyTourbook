This is a plugin for MyTourbook (http://mytourbook.sourceforge.net/mytourbook/) to import your data from a Macro cycle computer
from o_synce (http://www.o-synce.com/). This plugin is considered experimental, but basics should work. At the moment there is configuratio
available, and the device won't be erased after transfer. To use this plugin you will also need the following library:

This is also an osgi bundle (or plugin) for MyTourbook.

Note that you need the latest beta version of MyTourbook to use this Plugin

=== ToDo ===
* Most tour imports seem to be working but some have unrealistic data.
* Create unit tests to make sure further development doesn't break anything
* Automate the build.

And special thanks to o_synce who provided a free Macro unit and documentation so I can develop and test this
software. Very great community support!
